// Practice exercise 4.1

// 1. Create a variable with a Boolean value.
// 2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
// 3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console,
// using the following syntax:
// if(myVariable){
// //action
// }
// Logic Statements
// [ 74 ]
// 4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether
// the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the
// console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an
// ! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement
// insteadâ€”experiment!
// 5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes.


// Step 1: Create a variable with a Boolean value
var myVariable = true; // You can also change this to false to see different results.

// Step 2: Output the value of the variable to the console
console.log("myVariable:", myVariable);

// Step 3: Check whether the variable is true and output a message if it is
if (myVariable) {
  console.log("myVariable is true.");
}

// Step 4: Add another if statement with a ! (not) in front of the variable to check if it's not true
if (!myVariable) {
  console.log("myVariable is not true.");
}

// Alternatively, you can use an if-else statement to achieve the same result
if (myVariable) {
  console.log("myVariable is true.");
} else {
  console.log("myVariable is not true.");
}

// Step 5: Change the variable to the opposite value to see how the results change
myVariable = !myVariable; // Toggle the value (true to false or false to true)

// Output the changed value and retest the conditions
console.log("myVariable (changed):", myVariable);

  console.log("myVariable is true.");

// Practice exercise 4.2


// 1. Create a prompt to ask the user's age

// 4. If the input age is equal to or greater than 21, set the message variable to
// confirm entry to a venue and the ability to purchase alcohol
// 5. If the input age is equal to or greater than 19, set the message variable to
// confirm entry to the venue but deny the purchase of alcohol
// 6. Provide a default else statement to set the message variable to deny entry if
// none are true
// 7. Output the response message variable to the console

// Step 1: Create a prompt to ask the user's age
var userAge = prompt("Please enter your age:");

// Step 7: Output the response message variable to the console

// Practice exercise 4.3

// 1. Create a Boolean value for an ID variable
// 2. Using a ternary operator, create a message variable that will check whether
// their ID is valid and either allow a person into a venue or not
// 3. Output the response to the console


// Step 1: Create a Boolean value for an ID variable
var isIDValid = true; // Change this to false to see the opposite result.

// Step 2: Using a ternary operator, create a message variable to check the ID's validity
var message = isIDValid ? "You are allowed into the venue." : "You are not allowed into the venue.";

// Step 3: Output the response to the console
console.log(message);



// Practice exercise 4.4
// As discussed in Chapter 1, Getting Started with JavaScript, the JavaScript function Math.
// random() will return a random number in the range of 0 to less than 1, including 0
// but not 1. You can then scale it to the desired range by multiplying the result and
// using Math.floor() to round it down to the nearest whole number; for example, to
// generate a random number between 0 and 9:
// // random number between 0 and 1
// let randomNumber = Math.random();
// // multiply by 10 to obtain a number between 0 and 10
// randomNumber = randomNumber * 10;
// // removes digits past decimal place to provide a whole number
// RandomNumber = Math.floor(randomNumber);
// Chapter 4
// [ 81 ]
// In this exercise, we'll create a Magic 8-Ball random answer generator:
// 1. Start by setting a variable that gets a random value assigned to it. The value
// is assigned by generating a random number 0-5, for 6 possible results. You
// can increase this number as you add more results.
// 2. Create a prompt that can get a string value input from a user that you can
// repeat back in the final output.
// 3. Create 6 responses using the switch statement, each assigned to a different
// value from the random number generator.
// 4. Create a variable to hold the end response, which should be a sentence
// printed for the user. You can assign different string values for each case,
// assigning new values depending on the results from the random value.
// 5. Output the user's original question, plus the randomly selected case
// response, to the console after the user enters their question.

// Rock Paper Scissors game

// This is a game between a player and the computer, where both will make a random
// selection of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors (alternatively, you could create a version
// using real player input!). Rock will beat out Scissors, Paper will beat out Rock, and
// Scissors will beat out Paper. You can use JavaScript to create your own version of
// this game, applying the logic with an if statement. Since this project is a little more
// difficult, here are some suggested steps:
// 1. Create an array that contains the variables Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
// 2. Set up a variable that generates a random number 0-2 for the player and then
// do the same for the computer's selection. The number represents the index
// values in the array of the 3 items.
// 3. Create a variable to hold a response message to the user. This can show the
// random results for the player and then also the result for the computer of the
// matching item from the array.
// 4. Create a condition to handle the player and computer selections. If both are
// the same, this results in a tie.
// 5. Use conditions to apply the game logic and return the correct results.
// There are several ways to do this with the condition statements, but you
// could check which player's index value is bigger and assign the victory
// accordingly, with the exception of Rock beating Scissors.
// 6. Add a new output message that shows the player selection versus the
// computer selection and the result of the game



// Step 1: Create an array containing Rock, Paper, and Scissors
